# Diary Final
Created as a final project for Scalable Web Systems, this app was created as a way to show my expertise in using Node.js, JavaScript, Svelte, TailwindCSS, micro-services, logging, and Docker. This application is designed for a user to be able to create diary entries, with micro-services to automatically include the time & date, as well as store entry's ID and data. The app also features a tagging system, where a user to tag items with specific words to better summarize them.

Usage: If you have Docker and Docker-compose installed, all you need to do it run: `docker-compose up -d` in a terminal, and the website will be up on `localhost:3000`
